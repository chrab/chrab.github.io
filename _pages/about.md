My name is Christian Rab. I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Group of Prof. Barbara Ercolano at the [USM/LMU](https://www.usm.uni-muenchen.de/) in Munich and at the MPE in the [CAS group](https://www.mpe.mpg.de/CAS) of Prof. Paola Caselli.

My main interest is star and planet formation. To understand the (initial) conditions for planet-formation I use observations (e.g. ALMA) and model the circumstellar environment (disks, envelopes) of young stars using (mostly) the radiation thermo-chemical modelling code [ProDiMo](https://prodimo.iwf.oeaw.ac.at/).
